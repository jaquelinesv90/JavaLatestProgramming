Imperative vs Declarative Programming

Programming languages have been divided into two categories-- imperative languages and declarative languages

Imperative programming(How): Is a paradigm of computer programming where the program describes steps that change
the state of the computer.Unlike declarative programming, which describes "what" a program should accomplish, 
imperative programming explicitly tells the computer "how" to accomplish it. Programs written this way often compile to
binary executables that run more efficiently since all CPU instructions are themselves imperative statements. 

Declarative programming(What): Is based on stating the relationship between inputs and outputs.The actual computation procedure 
adopted is left to the runtime system.A declarative program can be viewed as a high level specification.Declarative programs
are shorter, supposedly easier to write, debug, maintain are generally slower than imperative programs in execution speed.
